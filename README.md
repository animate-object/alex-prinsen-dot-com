# alex-prinsen-dot-com
A site to show case projects and try new tech

# Todo
* A test suite!
* State management
* Sass and probably a css framework -- considering something light like milligram
* A service backed blog component, probably implemented 'in house' for practice


# Planned Features

| NAME | STATE | NOTES/RATIONALE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| state management  | done for now  | first use of redux for maggie page -- still learning |
| blog component    | in progress   | backend service is implemented. I want to implement the blog service because I have lots of brain thoughts I want to emit. I also think it is good e2e, full stack practice. |
| test suite        | up next       | as much as front end testing has never been my favorite task I recognize its value, especially as a baked in part of the deploy process |
| sass/css lib      | not started   | it's pragmatic not to write all your own css... I want to pretty up the site a bit and get experience with mainline tools (while maintaining the simple aesthetic|
| automated depoy   | not started   | I'm not in a huge rush for this as it's simple enough for me to accomplish with aws cli commands, but I want to learn more about automated build tools because of the immense value I've seen from CICD in enterprise settings |
